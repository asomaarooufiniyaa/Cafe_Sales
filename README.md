## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing and visualizing data for a cafe. The main objectives were to clean the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis, and create a professional, interactive dashboard using Power BI.

---

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning with Pandas

- Imported the raw dataset into Python using Pandas.
- Addressed issues such as:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Correcting data types.
  - Removing duplicate rows.
  - Standardizing inconsistent formatting.
- Verified the dataset’s quality through summary statistics and visual inspections.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization with Matplotlib

- Conducted initial analysis to understand trends and insights.
- Created simple yet informative visualizations, including:
  - Bar charts for sales performance.
  - Pie charts for sales distribution.
  - Line plots for trends over time.

### 3. Dashboard Creation with Power BI

- Imported the cleaned dataset into Power BI.
- Designed an interactive dashboard that includes:
  - Total sales and profits overview.
  - Performance comparison by categories (e.g., products or salespeople).
  - Monthly and yearly trends.
  - Filter and drill-down capabilities for user interactivity.

## Tools Used

- **Python**: For data cleaning and visualization.
  - Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Power BI**: For creating the interactive dashboard.

## Project Files

- `dirty_cafe_sales.csv`: Raw dataset before cleaning.
- `cleaned_cafe_sales.csv`: Dataset after cleaning.
- `Cafe_Sales_Chart.pbix`: Power BI file containing the interactive dashboard.
- Python scripts for data cleaning and visualization.

---

## How to Use the Project

1. Open the Python script files to review the data cleaning and visualization process.
2. Load the `Cafe_Sales_Chart.pbix` file in Power BI to interact with the dashboard.
3. Explore the dashboard to analyze sales trends and insights.

---

## Insights

- Data cleaning enhanced the dataset’s accuracy and usability.
- Visualizations provided quick and clear insights into key trends.
- The interactive Power BI dashboard enables detailed exploration of the cafe’s performance metrics.

---

## Next Steps

- Integrate advanced visualizations in Power BI for deeper insights.
- Automate data cleaning and dashboard updates for real-time analytics.
- Explore additional datasets to enrich the analysis.
